# 📊 E-Commerce Sales Performance & Trend Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive analysis of sales, customers, and product data using **Basic to Advanced SQL**. The workflow involved cleaning raw data, loading it into a relational database, and executing deep-dive queries to uncover business performance, temporal trends, and behavioral patterns.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **SQL (MySQL):** Primary engine for data transformation and analysis.
* **Relational DB:** Data storage and schema management.
* **ETL Process:** Data cleaning and structured loading from CSV sources.

## 🧪 SQL Concepts Used
* **Advanced Aggregations:** SUM, COUNT, AVG
* **Complex Logic:** CTEs, CASE Statements, Views
* **Analytical Functions:** Window Functions (Ranking, Running Totals, Moving Averages)
* **Data Structure:** Joins, Relational Database Design

---

## 📁 Key Analysis & Insights
* **Scale of Analysis:** Executed end-to-end SQL queries on a dataset representing **~$29M in revenue**, **23K+ customers**, and **270+ products**.
* **Accelerated Growth:** Identified through **CTEs and Window Functions** that over **50% of total revenue** was generated in the final year.
* **Volume-Driven Strategy:** Used **3-month moving averages** to detect a trend where sales volume increased significantly despite a sharp decline in average unit prices.
* **Product Catalog Health:** Classified products using **Ranking Functions**, identifying that **33%** of products are improving while **15%** are in decline.
* **Data Reusability:** Developed modular **SQL Views** to centralize KPIs (Recency, Lifespan, AOV), streamlining downstream reporting.

## 🧠 Analytical Summary
This project follows a structured analytical flow to decode business evolution:

1. **Exploration & Validation:** Audited geographic coverage and product structures to ensure data integrity.
2. **Baseline Metrics:** Established core KPIs (Total Sales, Orders, Customers) to create a snapshot of business health.
3. **Distribution & Efficiency:** Analyzed revenue by category vs. product count to identify "high-efficiency" categories (low product count, high revenue).
4. **Ranking:** Isolated top-performing customers and products to identify primary revenue drivers.
5. **Temporal Trends:**
    * **Cumulative Analysis:** Proved accelerating growth using running totals.
    * **Price vs. Volume:** Determined that growth was volume-led rather than price-led.
6. **Lifecycle Analysis:** Classified products as **Active, Aging, or Inactive** based on recency and sales duration.
7. **Optimization:** Encapsulated complex logic into reusable views for efficient future querying.
